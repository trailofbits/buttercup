# Buttercup Local Deployment Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully converted Buttercup from a Kubernetes-based cloud deployment to a local Docker Compose setup optimized for macOS. The implementation was completed by 8 parallel agents, each handling specific aspects of the conversion.

## Agent Accomplishments

### Agent 1: Deployment Cleanup ✅
- Removed entire `deployment/k8s/` directory (Helm charts, Kubernetes configs)
- Deleted all Terraform files (`*.tf`)
- Removed cloud-specific scripts
- Simplified deployment to just `Makefile`, `env.template`, and `README.md`
- Created clean Docker Compose focused deployment structure

### Agent 2: Unified Fuzzer Service ✅
- Created `/fuzzer/buttercup/unified_fuzzer/` with merged functionality
- Combined build-bot, fuzzer-bot, coverage-bot, and tracer-bot into single service
- Implemented threading model with Python queues for internal communication
- Maintained Redis interface for external communication
- Created `unified_fuzzer.Dockerfile` and migration script

### Agent 3: Docker Compose Simplification ✅
- Reduced `compose.yaml` from 328 to 210 lines
- Removed test profiles and unnecessary services
- Integrated unified fuzzer service
- Created `compose.override.yaml` for local development
- Added `local-dev.sh` helper script and documentation

### Agent 4: Local Environment & Scripts ✅
- Created `env.local` with minimal configuration
- Created comprehensive helper scripts in `scripts/local/`:
  - `start.sh`, `stop.sh`, `reset.sh`, `logs.sh`, `status.sh`, `quick-test.sh`
- Updated `.gitignore` for local environment files
- Created `.env.example` with clear instructions

### Agent 5: macOS & ARM64 Optimization ✅
- Updated all Dockerfiles for multi-platform support
- Created `docker/optimization/` with comprehensive guides:
  - Docker Desktop configuration
  - Performance tuning
  - ARM64 compatibility
- Created build and test scripts for ARM64
- Optimized for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)

### Agent 6: Cloud Dependency Removal ✅
- Made Langfuse and OpenTelemetry optional with graceful fallbacks
- Removed cloud registry dependencies (ghcr.io, gcr.io)
- Updated all image references to use local builds
- Cleaned environment configurations
- Created `CLOUD_REMOVAL.md` documentation

### Agent 7: Service Integration ✅
- Integrated scratch-cleaner as scheduler background task
- Moved corpus merger to scheduler background task
- Integrated POV reproducer into scheduler workflow
- Created `BackgroundTaskManager` for task orchestration
- Added comprehensive tests for integrated services

### Agent 8: Documentation Update ✅
- Updated `README.md` to focus on local deployment
- Created `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for K8s to Docker transition
- Created `LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md` for macOS developers
- Updated `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` with Docker commands
- Updated all documentation to remove cloud references

## Final Architecture

### Services (9 total, down from 15+):
1. **redis** - Message broker
2. **litellm + postgres** - LLM proxy
3. **orchestrator** - Task management and UI
4. **unified-fuzzer** - All fuzzing capabilities
5. **program-model** - Code analysis
6. **patcher** - Automated patching
7. **seed-gen** - Test generation
8. **dind** - Docker-in-Docker
9. **mock-competition-api** - Local testing

### Key Improvements:
- **50% reduction in services** through consolidation
- **Native ARM64 support** for Apple Silicon
- **Offline capability** except for LLM APIs
- **Simplified deployment** with helper scripts
- **Better resource utilization** with unified services
- **Clear documentation** for local development

## Usage

1. **Setup Environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Add your OpenAI API key to .env
   ```

2. **Start Services**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/local/start.sh
   ```

3. **Verify Setup**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/local/quick-test.sh
   ```

4. **Monitor Services**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/local/status.sh
   ./scripts/local/logs.sh -f
   ```

## Resource Requirements
- **Memory**: 16-20GB RAM
- **Storage**: 50GB disk space
- **CPU**: 8+ cores recommended
- **Docker Desktop**: Configured per `docker/optimization/macos-docker-config.md`

## Migration from Kubernetes
See `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions on migrating from the Kubernetes deployment.

## Next Steps
1. Test the unified deployment with real workloads
2. Optimize performance based on usage patterns
3. Consider adding development-specific features
4. Create automated tests for the local deployment
