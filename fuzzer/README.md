# Demo fuzzer.

General idea here is we have a set of builders and a fuzzer bot managed through redis queues. 

All commands are suggestions based on vibes at the moment and not really tested...

## Building:
... have a linux box 
Install poetry  
```
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

```
pyenv install 3.8
pyenv global 3.8
poetry shell
poetry install
```

## Demo prereqs

Nginx depedencies (this is to run the fuzz bot locally instead of in docker):
```
sudo apt-get install pcre2
```

```
git clone https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz.git
export OSS_FUZZ_PATH=$(pwd)/oss-fuzz
```

## Running:

### Start redis:

```
docker pull redis
docker run redis
export REDIS_IP=$(docker inspect \
  -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' <container>)
export REDIS_URL="redis://$REDIS_IP"
```

### Starting the orchestrator:

This orchestrator mocks the interactions of an actual orchestrator by receiving build outputs and adding them to a fuzzer distribution.

```
python fuzzing_infra/orchestrator.py --redis_url $REDIS_URL
```

## Starting a build bot

This starts a build bot that will build fuzzr harnesses using helper.py. Allow caching means it will be built directly in the ossfuzz directory. This mode allows for only building a harness once rather than snapshotting per request trees.
```
python fuzzing_infra/builder_bot.py  --redis_url $REDIS_URL --allow-caching
```

## Starting the fuzzer bot
```
python fuzzing_infra/fuzzer_bot.py --redis_url $REDIS_URL --timeout 120
```

## Sending a build request:

Creating a manual build request:
```
python fuzzing_infra/stimulate_build_bot.py --redis_url $REDIS_URL --target_package nginx --ossfuzz $OSS_FUZZ_PATH --engine libfuzzer --sanitizer address
```

This command should result in the builder emitting build logs and then fuzzer logs.

## On timeouts and OOMs

OSS Fuzz documents their settings for handling timeouts (anything which takes >65 seconds to reproduce) and out-of-memory (anything which uses >2.5GB of memory) [here](https://github.com/tob-challenges/oss-fuzz-aixcc/blob/aixcc-afc/docs/faq.md#how-do-you-handle-timeouts-and-ooms) and [here](https://github.com/tob-challenges/oss-fuzz-aixcc/blob/aixcc-afc/docs/advanced-topics/reproducing.md#fuzz-target-bugs).

Timeouts

  * Sometimes `tracer-bot` can hang. AIxCC has introduced a timeout flag to kill helper.py in [v1.2.0](https://github.com/tob-challenges/oss-fuzz-aixcc).
  * We set this timeout value to whatever the fuzzing harness's settings are, or default to 120 seconds (longer than oss-fuzz documents).

OOMs

  * We set `fuzzer-bot` and `tracer-bot` to have at least `4Gi` of memory during `minikube` testing.
  * We acknowledge that a fuzzing harness can specify `-rss_limit_mb=0` to disable memory limits, but these cases will likely be few and far between (upon examining the projects under oss-fuzz), and if it does get killed due to memory limitations, then our stacktrace will be empty and we can simply ignore and move on.
