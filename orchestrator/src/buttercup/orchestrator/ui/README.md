# Buttercup UI

- This is a replacement of the AIxCC competition API, which can submit tasks to the CRS, receive POVs/patches from the CRS, provide a GUI, etc.
- Basic skeleton created with `make generate-competition-api` in the `orchestrator` directory. This automatically generates a FastAPI application from the Swagger API.
